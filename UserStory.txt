As a user I would like some simple PowerShell code which will find all the storage accounts in my Azure subscription. 
It will interrogate the storage accounts and find all the containers and finally it will find all the storage blobs.
I then want a tab delimited or some kind of easily manipulated output on the list of files that have been discovered. 
Basically, I want this to be like a directory listing. I can then use this information to work out if there are any files 
out of date or as a general find out what I have currently got up in Azure stored.
Iâ€™ll be taking this code and cutting it up for other projects.
